## About Me

My first experience with computers was watching my oldest brother rig up a baud modem to our brand new Windows 1995 computer and play Warcraft II with his friend across town. The resulting thousand-dollar internet bill and my parents anger at my brother taught me nothing - I've been hooked on computers ever since.

Outside of work I have a wonderful wife and two daughters. My wife is a superhero because she still loves me even
though I'm known to be a dungeon master for Dungeons & Dragons campaigns and puts up with me taking an entire bookshelf (literally) of Warhammer 40k literature.
